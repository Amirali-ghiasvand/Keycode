# Keycode Visualizer

This is a simple project to display details about keyboard events. When you press any key on your keyboard, the application shows:
- **KeyCode**: The numeric code of the key.
- **Key**: The name of the key.
- **Location**: The location of the key on the keyboard.
- **Which**: The numeric code of the key (similar to KeyCode).
- **Code**: The string representing the physical key.

## Files
- `index.html`: Contains the structure of the application.
- `keycode.css`: Handles the styling and layout.
- `keycode.js`: Provides the logic to capture and display key event details.

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Press any key on your keyboard.
3. The page updates to show the key's details in real-time.


## Example
1. Open the application.
2. Press a key like `A`.
3. The screen will display:
   - **Key**: A
   - **KeyCode**: 65
   - **Location**: 0
   - **Which**: 65
   - **Code**: KeyA
